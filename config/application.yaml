# == DO NOT EDIT - MANAGED FILE ================================================
# This is an internal managed file and used to set the default configurations.
# Any changes to this file MIGHT BE LOST the next time the application is
# updated.
#
# Any value in this config may be overridden via the environment. This provides
# various benefits not limited to:
# * It prevents data loss when the application is updated, and
# * It prevents sensitive keys (e.g. the shared secret) from being checked into
#   the repo by accident
#
# Refer to the reference document for full details on the configuration keys:
# config/application.yaml.reference
# ==============================================================================

# EXAMPLE:
# To set the shared secret in the environment:
# export jwt_shared_secret=...Your shared secret ...
# export ... All the other REQUIRED configs ...

# REQUIRED:
# jwt_shared_secret:  # [REQUIRED]

# FULL UPSTREAM MODE:
# Setting the following line will put the server in Full Upstream Mode.
# The server must also be configured in PARTIAL UPSTREAM MODE
# full_upstream: true

# PARTIAL UPSTREAM MODE:
# Setting the following line will put the server in Partial Upstream MODE
# remote_url:
# remote_jwt:
remote_cluster: default

# STANDALONE NODE AND EXPLODING GROUP MODES
# The server will be in STANDALONE NODE MODE if neither of the UPSTREAM MODES
# have been selected.
#
# The server will be in EXPLODING GROUP MODE if FULL UPSTREAM MODE has not
# been selected.

# DYNAMIC DEFAULTS:
# The following may use relative paths from the install directory
# or hard coded to be an absolute path
